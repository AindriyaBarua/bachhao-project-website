### Done during Without Fear Fellowship: The Bachchao Project

After discussing with the team, we decided to make a website that would cater to victims of hate speech. It would be a website that would show up when a person searches what to do when they are being abused online.

### User documentation:  
### What the website does:  
The website helps the victim realise they arenâ€™t powerless when subjected to hate speech or online violence.
The website acts as an accumulator of three kinds of resources:
### Legal Resources:  
The user can enter comments and the website would analyze it and tell if the comment      violates any laws, and the exact IPC sections the comment can be punishable under, hence it would also have a link to lodge a complaint if the victim wants.  
### Technical Resources:  
An updated compilation of measures social media platforms themselves provide to help with hate speech, offensive content, trolling, etc and tutorials on how to use them.
### Mental Health Resources:  
From personal experience, mass trolling and hate speech may lead to panic attacks, anxiety, etc, so we also thought of adding a compilation of mental health professionals they could seek.  

### Developer documentation: 

The site was first developed as part of another website for Shor.ai where a hate speech bot would be downloadable, hence it has the name Ari as a place holder name for the website, which you can change by finding and replacing the word with new name.  

There are place holders for texts to add later. The fuction names are self-explanatory but there are also comments explaining what the functions do.
